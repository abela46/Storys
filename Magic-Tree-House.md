"It's still here," said Jack.
  "It looks empty," said Annie.
  Jack and his seven-year-old sister 
gazed up at a very tall oak tree. At the
top of the tree was a tree house.
  Late-morning sunlight lit the woods. It
was almost time for lunch.
  "Shhh!" said Jack. "What was that 
noise?"
  "What noise?"
  "I heard a noise," Jack said. He looked
around. "It sounded like someone coughing."

  "I didn't hear 
anything," said Annie.
"Come on. Let's go 
up."
  She grabbed onto 
the rope ladder and 
started climbing.
  Jack tiptoed over to 
a clump of bushes.

He pushed aside a small branch.
  "Hello?" he said. "Anybody 
there?" 
  There was no answer.
  "Come on!" Annie called down. 
"The tree house looks the same as
it did yesterday."
  Jack still felt that someone was
nearby. Could it be the person 
who'd put all the books in the tree 
house?
  "Ja-ack!"
  Jack gazed ovwe the top of the 
bushes.
  Was the mysterious person 
watching him now? The person whose name 
began with M?
  Maybe M wanted the gold medallion back. The one Jack had found on their dinosaur adventure.
