`"It's still here," said Jack.`
  `"It looks empty," said Annie.`
  `Jack and his seven-year-old sister `
`gazed up at a very tall oak tree. At the`
`top of the tree was a tree house.`
  `Late-morning sunlight lit the woods. It`
`was almost time for lunch.`
  `"Shhh!" said Jack. "What was that` 
`noise?"`
  `"What noise?"`
 ` "I heard a noise," Jack said. He looked`
`around. "It sounded like someone coughing."`

 ` "I didn't hear `
`anything," said Annie.`
`"Come on. Let's go `
`up."`
`  She grabbed onto `
`the rope ladder and` 
`started climbing.`
 ` Jack tiptoed over to `
`a clump of bushes.`

`He pushed aside a small branch.`
  `"Hello?" he said. "Anybody `
`there?"` 
  `There was no answer.`
  `"Come on!" Annie called down. `
`"The tree house looks the same as`
`it did yesterday."`
  `Jack still felt that someone was`
`nearby. Could it be the person `
`who'd put all the books in the tree `
`house?`
 ` "Ja-ack!"`
  `Jack gazed ovwe the top of the `
`bushes.`
 ` Was the mysterious person `
`watching him now? The person whose name `
`began with M?`
 ` Maybe M wanted the gold medallion back. `
`The one Jack had found on their dinosaur `
`adventure.`
`Maybe M wanted the leather bookmark`
`back. The one from the castle book.`
  `There was an M on the medallion.`
`And an M on the bookmark. But what did M`
`stand for?`
  `"Tomorrow I'll bring everything back,"`
`Jack said loudly.`
 ` A breeze swept through the woods. The `
`leaves rattled.`
 ` "Come on!" called Annie.`
`  Jack went back to the big oak tree.` 
`He grabbed the rope ladder and climb up.`
`  At the top he crawled through the hole `
`in the wooden floor. He threw down his rucksack `
`and pushed his glasses ubti place.`
